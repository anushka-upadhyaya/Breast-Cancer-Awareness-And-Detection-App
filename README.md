# Breast Cancer Awareness and Detection Using a WebApp and AI Model
## There can be life after breast cancer. The prerequisite is early detection.

## Inspiration
In a lifetime, 1 in 8 women in the World develops breast cancer, as reported by the National Breast Cancer Foundation. Although breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the world, increased visibility, early detection/screening, and improved care options have helped to reduce death rates in the past 30 years. It's our priority to raise awareness for Breast Cancer and detect breast Cancer at an early stage in life hence we are in the need to develop such a solution.

## What Our App Do?
1. Help breast cancer patients and carriers find the knowledge that is accurate and trustworthy with ease.
2. The Solution to monitor side effects of specific cancer treatments in Breast Cancer.
3. The Solution to monitor side effects of specific cancer treatments in Breast Cancer by the government.
4. The solution to detect Breast Cancer at an early stage in life.

## How we built it?
We have created a web application using PHP, Perl and javascript that has numerous facts, features, functionalities to raise awareness for Breast cancer. We have also made an AI-based model which will be based on a different extracted feature from an X-ray predicts whether the tumor is malignant or benign.   

## Challenges we ran into
The idea itself is tricky as very few people think of such a sensitive concept. 
Also, Understanding the UCL data set for the prediction of breast cancer is bit complex.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Thinking of an Idea that is new to the society and is for the social good for our Women. 
Implementing our idea into a WebApp Prototype Model
Creating Awareness among people especially women of all ages.
Detecting the Breast Cancer at an early stage in women using our AI Model Dataset Analysis.

## What we learned
The idea itself was really challenging for us.
We learned the proper way to implement our idea into something from where anyone in the society can benifit.
We learned the Art of Solution-Building and integrating SOciety related problems into Technological Solutions.
Through the challenges, we learned a lot of WebApp Designing.
The Languagues used were in itself very challenging.
Dealing, Cleaning and Preprocessing of Data Collected.

## What's next for Breast Cancer Awareness and Detection?
We are ready with our model. In the long run, we need to make an automated image processor for the extraction of features and implementing them on the web.
